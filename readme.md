# Github Collaboration Demo

This is a small demo for my students on how to use Git and Github to collaborate on software projects together.


# How to Collaborate

1. Clone Repo with `git clone https://github.com/EvilWeasel/kn23_1.git`
2. Create Feature-Branch with `git branch <nameofbranch> && git checkout <nameofbranch>`
3. Make changes...
4. Add changes to staging and commit `git add . && git commit -m "message"`
5. Push branch `git push -u origin <nameofbranch>`
